# Part A) Client Server TCP:
- Simulate a basic client-server interaction over TCP with added functionalities for packet loss and corruption simulation. The simulation parameters allow you to control the behavior of the communication and observe how the system handles different scenarios.
- Instructions:
  1) start serverTCPloop.py
  2) start clientTCP.py
  3) observe sending packets between client and server

----------

# Part B) Packet Forwarding with Routing Table
- Designed and implemented network routing and access control rules, utilizing IP ranges, gateways, and subnet masks for optimal traffic management across multiple interfaces.
- Configured routing policies for diverse IP address spaces, demonstrating proficiency in network configuration and problem-solving within a controlled environment.
- Instructions:
  1) start pktforward 
  2) when prompted input your Routing Table (provided: routingtable.txt)
  3) input a destination IP address
  4) observe provided information about the forwarding, such as the destination IP address, next hop IP address, and the interface through which the packet will be forwarded.
